## üåü Introduction

**MASK X** is a powerful Python-based tool designed for ethical hackers, security researchers, and penetration testers to learn and understand phishing link masking techniques. This tool allows you to mask any phishing URL (e.g., a fake login page) behind a legitimate-looking domain (e.g., `https://facebook.com`) with social engineering words to make it appear trustworthy. Built with simplicity and functionality in mind, MASK X is perfect for educational purposes and authorized testing environments.
